Form Component
-------------------------------

The Form component enables Psychopy to be used as a questionnaire tool, where
participants can be presented with a series of questions requiring responses.
Form items, defined as questions and response pairs, are presented
simultaneously onscreen with a scrollable viewing window.

*Note*: We have now introduced `Pavlovia Surveys <https://pavlovia.org/docs/surveys/overview>`_ which allow you to create online questionnaires. You can either use them by themselves or in conjunction with your experiments. Click here to watch our `Pavlovia Surveys Launch Webinar <https://youtu.be/1fs8CVKBPGk>`_ to find out more.

Works in:
    PsychoPy, PsychoJS

**Note: Since this is still in beta, keep an eye out for bug fixes.**

.. _formcomponent-startVal:

Start
    When the Form Component should start, see :ref:`startStop`.

Expected start (s)
    If you are using frames to control timing of your stimuli, you can add an expected start time to display the component timeline in the routine.

Start type
    How do you want to define your start point?
    
    Options:

    * condition
    
.. _formcomponent-stopVal:

Stop
    When the Form Component should stop, see :ref:`startStop`.

    If you are using frames to control timing of your stimuli, you can add an expected duration to display the component timeline in the routine.

        The item question string

    *itemWidth*
        The question width between 0 : 1

    *type*
        The type of rating e.g., 'choice', 'rating', 'slider', 'free text'

    *responseWidth*
        The question width between 0 : 1

    *options*
        A sequence of tick labels for options e.g., yes, no

        Response object layout e.g., 'horiz' or 'vert'

    *itemColor*
        The question text font color

    *responseColor*

    *granularity*
        If you are using a slider, what do you want the granularity of the slider to be?
    
    Missing column headers will be replaced by default entries, with the exception of `itemText` and `type`, which are required. The default entries are:
    
    *index*
        0 (increments for each item)
    
    *itemWidth*
        0.7

    *responseWidth*
