Movie Component
-------------------------------

The Movie component allows movie files to be played from a variety of formats (e.g. mpeg, avi, mov). 

The movie can be positioned, rotated, flipped and stretched to any size on the screen (using the :doc:`../../general/units` given).

Categories:
    Stimuli
Works in:
    PsychoPy, PsychoJS


Parameters
-------------------------------

Basic
===============================

The required attributes of the stimulus, controlling its basic function and behaviour


.. _moviecomponent-name:

Name
    Everything in a |PsychoPy| experiment needs a unique name. The name should contain only letters, numbers and underscores (no punctuation marks or spaces).
    
.. _moviecomponent-startVal:

Start
    When the Movie Component should start, see :ref:`startStop`.
    
.. _moviecomponent-startEstim:

Expected start (s)
    If you are using frames to control timing of your stimuli, you can add an expected start time to display the component timeline in the routine.
    
.. _moviecomponent-startType:

Start type
    How do you want to define your start point?
    
    Options:
    
    * time (s)
    
    * frame N
    
    * condition
    
.. _moviecomponent-stopVal:

Stop
    When the Movie Component should stop, see :ref:`startStop`.
    
.. _moviecomponent-durationEstim:

Expected duration (s)
    If you are using frames to control timing of your stimuli, you can add an expected duration to display the component timeline in the routine.
    
.. _moviecomponent-stopType:

Stop type
    How do you want to define your end point?
    
    Options:
    
    * duration (s)
    
    * duration (frames)
    
    * time (s)
    
    * frame N
    
    * condition
    
.. _moviecomponent-movie:

Movie file
    A filename for the movie (including path)
    
.. _moviecomponent-forceEndRoutine:

Force end of Routine
    Should the end of the movie cause the end of the Routine (e.g. trial)?
    
Layout
===============================

Position [x,y]
    Position of this stimulus (e.g. [1,2] )
    
.. _moviecomponent-units:

Spatial units
    Spatial units for this stimulus (e.g. for its :ref:`position <moviecomponent-pos>` and :ref:`size <moviecomponent-size>`), see :ref:`units` for more info.
    
    Options:
    
    * from exp settings
    
    * deg
    
    * cm

    * center
    
    * top-center
    
    * bottom-center
    
    * center-left
    
    * center-right
    
    * top-left
    
    * top-right
    
    * bottom-left
    
    * bottom-right
    
.. _moviecomponent-ori:

Orientation
    Orientation of this stimulus (in deg)
    
    Options:
    
    * -360
    
    * 360
    
Appearance
===============================

How should the stimulus look? Colors, borders, styles, etc.


.. _moviecomponent-opacity:

Opacity
    Vary the transparency, from 0.0 (invisible) to 1.0 (opaque)
    
.. _moviecomponent-contrast:

Contrast
    Contrast of the stimulus (1.0=unchanged contrast, 0.5=decrease contrast, 0.0=uniform/no contrast, -0.5=slightly inverted, -1.0=totally inverted)
    
Playback
===============================

How should stimulus play? Speed, volume, etc.


.. _moviecomponent-loop:

Loop playback
    Whether the movie should loop back to the beginning on completion.
    
.. _moviecomponent-No-audio:
