Slider Component
-------------------------------

A Slider uses mouse input to collect ratings, all sliders have the same basic structure (a line, rectangle or series of dots to indicate the range of values, several tick marks and labels, a marker) but their appearance can be varied significantly by changing the `style` parameter. For example, a `radio` style Slider features several dots and a circular marker, while a `scrollbar` style Slider features a translucent rectangle with a long marker like the page scrollbar on a website.

Parameters
-------------------------------

Basic
===============================

The required attributes of the stimulus, controlling its basic function and behaviour


.. _slidercomponent-name:

Name 
    Everything in a |PsychoPy| experiment needs a unique name. The name should contain only letters, numbers and underscores (no punctuation marks or spaces).
    
.. _slidercomponent-startVal:

Start 
    When the Slider Component should start, see :ref:`startStop`.
    
.. _slidercomponent-startEstim:

Expected start (s) 
    If you are using frames to control timing of your stimuli, you can add an expected start time to display the component timeline in the routine.
    
.. _slidercomponent-startType:

Start type 
    How do you want to define your start point?
    
    Options:
    
    * time (s)
    
    * frame N
    
    * condition
    
.. _slidercomponent-stopVal:

Stop 
    When the Slider Component should stop, see :ref:`startStop`.
    
.. _slidercomponent-durationEstim:

Expected duration (s) 
    If you are using frames to control timing of your stimuli, you can add an expected duration to display the component timeline in the routine.
    
.. _slidercomponent-stopType:

Stop type 
    How do you want to define your end point?
    
    Options:
    
    * duration (s)
    
    * duration (frames)
    
    * time (s)
    
    * frame N
    
    * condition
    
.. _slidercomponent-forceEndRoutine:

Force end of Routine 
    Should setting a rating (releasing the mouse) cause the end of the Routine (e.g. trial)?
    
.. _slidercomponent-styles:

Styles 
    Discrete styles to control the overall appearance of the slider.
    
    Options:
    
    * slider
    
    * rating
    
    * radio
    
    * scrollbar
    
    * choice
    
.. _slidercomponent-ticks:

Ticks (*if :ref:`slidercomponent-styles` isn't =='radio'*)
    The ticks that will be place on the slider scale. The first and last ticks will be placed on the ends of the slider, and the remaining are spaced between the endpoints corresponding to their values. For example, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) will create 5 evenly spaced ticks. (1, 3, 5) will create three ticks, one at each end and one in the middle.
    
.. _slidercomponent-labels:

Labels 
    The text to go with each tick (or spaced evenly across the ticks). If you give 3 labels but 5 tick locations then the end and middle ticks will be given labels. If the labels can’t be distributed across the ticks then an error will be raised. If you want an uneven distribution you should include a list matching the length of ticks but with some values set to None.
    
.. _slidercomponent-granularity:

Granularity (*if :ref:`slidercomponent-styles` isn't =='radio'*)
    Specifies the minimum step size (0 for a continuous scale, 1 for integer rating scale)
    
.. _slidercomponent-initVal:

Starting value 
    Value of the slider befre any response, leave blank to hide the marker until clicked on
