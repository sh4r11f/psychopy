Making edits to PsychoPy's documentation
=========================================

First you'll need to have your own "fork" of |PsychoPy| - this is a copy of the code which is yours 
to edit, without affecting the main code. :ref:`Click here for a how-to for forking |PsychoPy| <forkPsychoPy>`

If you only want to change a single file:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, you've spotted a typo in one of the documentation pages, want to fix a broken link, or add in a few extra paragraphs to improve the clarity of the page. Essentially anything that involves you changing just one file. 
The easiest way to do this is directly within `GitHub <https://www.github.com>`_ itself. 

If you're not already aware, it's worth noting how the URLs in the documentation are linked to the folder structure of the PsychoPy repository: 
All of the documentation files are located in the folder docs > source. 
Each html page is created from a reStructured text (rst) file, and these files are stored in several folders. 
For instance, the page: https://psychopy.org/builder/routines.html is created from the routines.rst file located in: docs/source/builder. 

**Let's imagine that you want to change that routines.rst file:**

1. In your fork of the PsychoPy repository, click through to the routines.rst file located in: docs/source/builder and click on the 'edit' pencil icon:

2. Make the changes you need to.
3. Click on the 'Commit changesâ€¦' button that becomes active when you've made changes:

.. figure:: /images/commit_changes_rst.png

4. Add a commit message: For documentation changes we use 'DOC:' followed by a brief description of what we've changed (see :ref:`usingRepos` for more on commit messages):

      :scale: 60%

5. Commit your changes: This commits the changes you've made to your PsychoPy repository. You now need to make a pull request so that those changes can be merged into the main PsychoPy repository. 

Make a pull request:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click back into your main PsychoPy repository:

.. figure:: /images/back_to_psychopy.png

2. Click on the message that says 'Compare and pull request':

.. figure:: /images/comp_pr.png

3. As you want to contribute to the documentation on the website, you'll need to select 'release' as your base branch:

4. Make sure the title of your pull request matches the one that you put as your commit message. You can add a description of your changes if you like, too. Then click 'Create pull request':

.. figure:: /images/create_pr.png

5. You've made a pull request! Your code will be reviewed, and you'll receive an email when your changes have been pulled in!
