How-to guides
=====================================

If you're wondering how to do something you're in the right place!

How do I build experiments?
----------------------------------------------

See the guides below to learn how to make some classic experiments.

.. grid:: 1 2 3 4
   :gutter: 1

   .. grid-item-card:: Stroop Task
      :link: stroop
      :link-type: ref
      :img-top: ./experiments/thumbnails/stroop.png

      Report the color of words while ignoring their content. 
      
      A great starting point for learning to use PsychoPy!

   .. grid-item-card:: Lexical Decision Task
      :link: lexical_decision
      :link-type: ref
      :img-top: ./experiments/thumbnails/lexical_decision.png

      Decide if a word is a "real" word or not.
   
   .. grid-item-card:: Digit Span Task
      :link: digit_span
      :link-type: ref
      :img-top: ./experiments/thumbnails/digit_span.png

      A basic test of working memory.
   
   .. grid-item-card:: N-Back Task
      :link: n_back
      :link-type: ref
      :img-top: ./experiments/thumbnails/n_back.png

      Decide if a stimulus is the same as the stimulus n trials back.

How do I extend experiments with code?
----------------------------------------------
.. toctree::
